    <!--The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" "email" etc - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)  -->
